/** section: Language
 * class PeriodicalExecuter
 *
 *  A class that oversees the calling of a particular function periodically.
 *
 *  `PeriodicalExecuter` shields you from multiple parallel executions of the
 *  `callback` function, should it take longer than the given interval to
 *  execute.
 *
 *  This is especially useful if you use one to interact with the user at
 *  given intervals (e.g. use a prompt or confirm call): this will avoid
 *  multiple message boxes all waiting to be actioned.

   *  - frequency (Number): the amount of time, in sections, to wait in between
   *      callbacks.
   *
   *  Creates an `PeriodicalExecuter`.
